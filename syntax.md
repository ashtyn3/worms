# Syntax

## Variables

Broks' variables are pretty similar to other programming languages, but all variable names must start with a lowercase letter.

$$
v \rightarrow T = D.
$$

â€‹This syntax is common across most statements in Brok. The statement starts $$v$$(take notice that v is lower case and not upper-case), which is the name. Brok then uses $$\rightarrow$$to indicate that the tokens following will be  $$v$$'s type. You can think of this like $$v$$ returns the type of $$T$$. Finally, $$D$$ repersents the value of v with respect to type $$T$$.&#x20;
